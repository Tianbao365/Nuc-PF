# Nuc-PF
Introduction

Nuc-PF is a collection of tools for training nucleosome footprint with multiple histone modification datasets to find potential pioneer factor regulations. We have used Nuc-PF successfully to find GATA2 as pioneer factor in LNCap cell lines. If you wish to focus on PF-associated states (downstream of Nuc-PF), we recommend that only the PF of interest be used, although Nuc-PF supports multiple PFs.

Quick Start
Step 1: Nucleosome positioning and spacing detection.
MNase-seq data with MNase-ChIP-seq datasets were preferred for this pipeline.





Dependencies

Nuc-PF is written in python as several scripts and should run on any x86 64-bit Linux system, however a computer with several gigabytes of RAM is strongly recommended to avoid an out-of-memory error.
